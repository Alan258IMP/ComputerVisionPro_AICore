# ComputerVisionPro_AICore

This Python project is an implementation of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game with camera. The model will take an image with the camera and recognize if it's rock, paper or scissors through a machine-learning model created with [Teachable-Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/ ).

## Milestone 1 & 2: Creating the machine-learning model

Firstly I created the model with 4 classes: rock, paper, scissors and nothing. I fed ~250 sample images to each class with the camera on my laptop. The sample images were then used to train the model through 60 epochs. After training the model seems to distinguish each class reasonably well.

## Milestone 3: Install the libraries for the model

I installed the necessary dependencies for this project including opencv-python, tensorflow and ipykernel in a new virtual conda environment.

## Milestone 4: Code the game 

To be completed.
